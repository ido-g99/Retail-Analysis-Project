# Retail Analysis Project (MySQL)

## Objective
Analyze retail sales data to identify revenue drivers, peak demand periods, and store performance differences in order to support staffing and inventory decisions.

## Dataset
Synthetic but realistic retail transaction data representing sales from 10 stores over a three-month period (October–December 2025).

The dataset includes:
- Stores (store name and city)
- Products (food and beverage items with pricing)
- Sales transactions (date, hour, quantity)

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (joins, aggregations, date functions)

## Key Business Questions
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- When do peak sales hours occur?
- How do sales patterns differ by store and city?
- Are there observable sales spikes during special events (e.g., New Year’s Eve)?
- How does product demand vary between morning and evening hours?

## Analysis & Insights
- Sales peak between 18:00–22:00, indicating the need for increased evening staffing.
- Medium scoop products are the most frequently sold items.
- Premium products (e.g., Dubai items) generate high revenue.
- Stores in Haifa outperform other cities, with the Carmel branch leading sales.
- Morning sales volumes are lower, but beverage items dominate early hours.
- New Year’s Eve shows a significant increase in total sales and units per transaction.

## Conclusions & Recommendations
- Increase staffing levels during evening peak hours and special events.
- Ensure sufficient inventory of high-demand products, especially medium scoops.
- Promote premium products through targeted marketing to maximize revenue.
- Adjust staffing strategies midweek based on observed demand patterns.
- Plan for seasonal and event-driven demand fluctuations.
